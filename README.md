# Numbers and Messaging .NET SDK

**flowroute-net-sdk** is a .NET API Wrapper that provides methods for interacting with [v1](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/numbers/overview) and [v2](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/messaging/overview/) of the Flowroute API. These methods can be used to accomplish the following:
## Number Management
* Search for purchasable phone numbers
* Purchase phone numbers
* View your owned phone numbers and their related details
* Create new inbound routes
* Update the primary and failover route on a phone number

## Messaging
* Send an outbound SMS from a Flowroute phone number
* Retrieve a Message Detail Record (MDR) by searching for a specific message record ID 

### Documentation 
To work with the SDK, please read and follow the steps in the [Flowroute .NET Library v1](http://developer.flowroute.com/libraries/v1/dot-net/).
